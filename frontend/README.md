# IoU-Visualisation Frontend

To run the frontend, run `yarn` and `yarn dev` in `./iou`:

```sh
cd ./iou
yarn
yarn dev
```

You will need to install yarn.

If you get an error that says you don't have `vite` installed, make sure you are in the right directory, and run `yarn` before running `yarn dev`.
